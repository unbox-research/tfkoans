## The Task

Read in the training data from this directory (TODO), use
stochastic gradient descent to fit a linear regression model
to the data, and then compute the mean squared error on
the test data.

## Generating the Data

Run the notebook `make_log_reg_data.ipynb` to create the
sample data that can be used to train and test the tf version
of logistic regression.

TODO(tyler): Consider setting up non-notebook ways to run these.
