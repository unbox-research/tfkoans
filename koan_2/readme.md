## The Task

Read in the training data from `lin_reg_data.pkl`, use
gradient descent to fit a linear regression model
to the data, and then compare your (mean-squared) loss
and weights to the gold standard values in
`make_log_reg_data.ipynb`.

## Generating the Data

Run the notebook `make_log_reg_data.ipynb` to create the
sample data (which will be written to `lin_reg_data.pkl`)
that can be used to train and test the tf version
of logistic regression.
